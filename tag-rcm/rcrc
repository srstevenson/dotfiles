# rcm doesn't provide a way to conditionally link dotfiles based on
# operating system, but it does based on hostname. Therefore set
# `HOSTNAME` to the lower cased operating system name, so that
# dotfiles in, for example, the `host-openbsd` directory are
# automatically linked only on OpenBSD hosts.
HOSTNAME="$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')"
